## Hi! 

I'm a student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) studying Computer Science. My personal projects focus on robotics, electronics, embedded systems, and some web/app development. I keep all of my projects open source, feel free to use them!

If you have a question about a project, feel free to send me an email: dgorbunov [at] wpi [dot] edu.
