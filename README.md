I'm a driven student studying Computer Science. In my free time, I create open-source projects driven by interests in networks, embedded systems, security, and interactive media. I keep all of my projects open source, feel free to use them!

If you have a question about a project, feel free to send me an email: dgorbunov [at] wpi [dot] edu.
