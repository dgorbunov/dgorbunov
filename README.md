## Hi!

I'm a student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute studying Computer Science. My personal projects focus on electronics and embedded systems. I keep all of my projects open source, feel free to use them!

If you have a question about a project, feel free to reach me at *dgorbunov {at} wpi.edu*
