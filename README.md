### Hi!

I'm a student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst studying Computer Science with a passion for electronics. My projects typically focus on developing and programming embedded systems. I try to keep everything I do open source, feel free to use anything you'd like!

Currently competing in MIT 6.147 Battlecode — MIT's annual programming competition.
