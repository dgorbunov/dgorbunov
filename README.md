## Hi!

I'm a student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst studying Computer Science. My projects focus on electronics and embedded systems engineering. I keep all of my projects open source, feel free to use them!

If you have a question about a project, feel free to reach me at *dgorbunov {at} umass.edu*
