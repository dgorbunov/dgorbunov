### Hi, I'm Daniel!

I'm a High School student from Lexington, MA interested in electrical engineering using circuits and embedded systems. I mainly use C++/C# and Java for embedded systems. I program for [@FTC-WeAreRobo](https://github.com/FTC-WeAreRobo) and am part of [@HackClub](https://github.com/HackClub). I keep most of my projects open source in public repos.

Check out some of my projects below!
