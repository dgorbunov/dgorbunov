### Hi, I'm Daniel!

I'm a High School student from Lexington, MA interested in electrical engineering using circuits and embedded systems. I use C++ mainly for embedded systems projects, but am equally skilled in Java for FTC . I program for [@FTC-WeAreRobo](https://github.com/FTC-WeAreRobo) and am part of [@HackClub](https://github.com/HackClub).
